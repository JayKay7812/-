## 题目二
### 1 找出互不认识的人
```
with t as (
select friend1 as m from acquaintance
union 
select friend2 from acquaintance
)
select t1.m as m1, t2.m as m2
from t as t1, t as t2
where t1.m<>t2.m
and not exists (select * from acquaintance where (friend1=t1.m and friend2=t2.m) or (friend2=t1.m and friend1=t2.m));
```
### 2 找出只在一个类别里出现的人
```
with t as(
SELECT friend1 AS m, class FROM acquaintance
UNION
SELECT friend2, class FROM acquaintance
)
SELECT t1.m
FROM t AS t1
WHERE NOT EXISTS(SELECT * FROM t WHERE m=t1.m AND class<>t1.class);
```
### 3 找出在所有类别里都有朋友的人
```
with t as(
SELECT friend1 AS m, class FROM acquaintance
UNION
SELECT friend1 ,class FROM acquaintance
)
SELECT m
FROM t AS t1
WHERE m=t1.m AND NOT EXISTS(SELECT * FROM t WHERE t.class<>t1.class);
```
### 4 找出每个类别里面朋友最多的人
```
with t as (
select M,class,sum(cn) as cnt from 
(select friend1 AS M,class,count(*) as cn from acquaintance group by friend1,class
union all
select friend2 AS M,class,count(*) as cn from acquaintance group by M,class)
as t group by M,class)
select * from t AS t1 where cnt=(select max(cnt) from t where t1.class=t.class)
ORDER BY class;
```
### 5 找出在同一类别里面通过朋友而结识的其他朋友
```
with t as 
(
select friend1 AS M1, friend2 AS M2, class from acquaintance group by friend1,friend2,class
union all
select friend2 AS M1, friend1 AS M2, class from acquaintance group by M1,M2,class
)
select a1.friend1, a1.friend2, a1.class
from acquaintance as a1
where exists
(select * from (
select t.M2 from t where a1.friend1=t.M1 and a1.class=t.class
) as fof1,
(
select t.M2 from t where a1.friend2=t.M1 and a1.class=t.class
)as fof2
where(fof1.M2=fof2.M2) and (fof1.M2<>friend2) and (fof2.M2<>friend1))
ORDER BY friend1;
```
### 6 找出这样的人，通过他而结识的朋友对最多
```
with 
t as 
(
select friend1,friend2
from   acquaintance
union all
select friend2,friend1
from   acquaintance
),
related as
(
select t1.friend1,
       t1.friend2 as midman,
       t2.friend2 
from   t as t1
       inner join t as t2
         on t1.friend2 = t2.friend1
)
select midman,count(*) as rlt_index
from (
        select *
        from   related as rlt
        where  rlt.friend1 <> rlt.friend2
     ) a group by midman		 
ORDER BY rlt_index DESC;
```
### 7 找出臭味相投的朋友，他们在所出现的所有类别里面都是朋友
```

```
